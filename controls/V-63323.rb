For standalone systems, this is NA.

Virtualization based security, including Credential Guard, currently cannot be
implemented in virtual desktop implementations (VDI) due to specific supporting
requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run
the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.

For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon
logoff, this is NA.

Verify the system has a TPM and is ready for use.
Run \"tpm.msc\".
Review the sections in the center pane.
\"Status\" must indicate it has been configured with a message such as \"The
TPM is ready for use\" or \"The TPM is on and ownership has been taken\".
TPM Manufacturer Information - Specific Version = 2.0 or 1.2

If a TPM is not found or is not ready for use, this is a finding.

NOTE:  The severity level for the requirement will be upgraded to CAT II
starting January 2020."
